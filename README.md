**Regression Problem 1: Predicting the Health of an Organism**
A machine learning regression project to predict an organism's health based on given features.

**Project Overview**
This project focuses on predicting the health of an organism using regression techniques. The model is evaluated using:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

**Dataset**
The dataset consists of two CSV files:

1️⃣ train.csv – Contains labeled training data with features and target values.
2️⃣ test.csv – Contains test data without target values, used for predictions.

Each file includes various biological and environmental features related to the organism's health.
**Tech Stack**
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-Learn

Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)

**Project Workflow**
✅ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
✅ Feature Engineering
✅ Model Training & Evaluation
